# Sporting Images Prototype

A UI that shows a random sports photo

## Demo

https://sporting-ui.netlify.app

## Concept

To support the brief of showing a random “sports” photo from the Unsplash API, I continued this theme to create a randomly generated UI. This light-hearted creative prototype reflects a little of the unpredictable character of sports, but, perhaps aspects could be considered useful for user-focused design and drive traffic in new ways. A bold design leveraging features (ie: system fonts) helps enable better performance and functionality. The interface is also accessible via the tab key to help all types of users.

## Features

- JavaScript client-side application
- Responsive design
- Batch fetch images (x10 at a time)
- Randomly select from pre-configured layouts
- Random theme per image

## Technology

- React.js (Create React App using CSS modules and custom environment variables)

## Methodology

- As a prototype this has been developed using Chrome
- File structure keeping related code as close as possible
- Conventional commit format

## Development

- Pull repo
- `npm install` for dependencies
- `npm run start` to launch locally
- `index.js` development entry point

## Dependencies

- Node 8.16.0
- NPM

## Next Steps

With more time I would consider:

- Logic based layouts
- Logic based animations
- Abstract state globally
- Abstract theme to Context
