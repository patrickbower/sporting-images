## Concept

To support the brief of showing a random “sports” photo
from the Unsplash API, I continued this theme to create a randomly generated UI. This light-hearted prototype reflects a little of the unpredictable character of sports, but, perhaps aspects could be considered useful for keeping a user interested and drive traffic in new ways.
